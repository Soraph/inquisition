Inquisition
===========

Inquisition.sh will take a list of CSS rules that needs to be removed from a specific CSS file and will output a purified file.


You may get a list of unused CSS rules from various services, I personaly use the Chrome developer tools (Audit tab).

## Important
Use http://refresh-sf.com/yui/ with the option "Insert a line breaks after '}' characters." to sanitize the input CSS file.
